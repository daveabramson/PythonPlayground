# PythonPlayground
a place to play and learn some stuff about writing python...

This project contains code I wrote during my initial learning with python. It is likely not useful outside of trivial examples.

There is a VS code snippet in the project that you can import and use. Once imported, type "pytest" to access the snippet. The snippet the test
naming convention from "The Art Of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove.

Things that I learned while creating this project:
1. How to create python projects in VS
2. That splitting python code up into multiple projects is just as easy as other languages
3. Python comes with a unit test module that is easy to use, so there is no excuse for un-unit-tested python code
4. A basic Abstract Base Class with two children
